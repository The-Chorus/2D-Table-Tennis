# 2D Table Tennis
learning to code with 2D Table Tennis
## About
### Description
This is a pong-like game written in Typescript.
Pong is a table-tennis themed two-dimensional twitch sports game.
The original Pong was released by Atari in 1972 and created by Allan Alcorn as a training excercise, and was itself based on a ping-pong game included in the Magnavox Odyssey.
### Purpose
This project was started primarily for @The-Chorus to learn how to code and how to use a Version Control System with the help of @IbisLiven. The purpose of this project is not to be useful, performant, or even very good — only to be a teaching oppurtunity.
### Goals
1. Learn basic coding concepts by doing.
2. Create a functioning pong-game.
3. Learn how to maintain a codebase.
4. Add features for more learning oppurtunities.
## Usage
### Installation
This project has no code yet, it cannot be installed.
### Controls
Initially the controls will be `w` and `s` for player one `↑` and `↓` for player two. 
Eventually, configuration may be allowed. 
Controller support may be added in the future.
### Configuration
Initially the game will use a default configuration and have **no configuration options**, however configuration options may be added in the future, such as: 
- colour options;
- control configuration;
- difficulty adjustments:
	- ball speed,
	- paddle speed;
- scoring adjustments:
	- different winning scores,
	- a two-point lead requirement for winning, or 
	- different scoring systems such as the tennis scoring system;
- the option for matches; and 
- the option for playing doubles games.
### Gameplay
Pong consists of a game field/window, a ball which moves in straight lines through the field, and two paddles on either end which can move vertically to return the ball.

There are two players, each player controls their paddle and their objective is to return to ball to the other player while preventing the other player from returning the ball to them.

*a single-player mode with a computer opponent may be added in the future.*
*two-player / four-player modes for doubles games may be added in the future.*
#### Scoring
Pong uses a basic incremental scoring system. When a player fails to return the ball to the other, the other player receives one point.

*The option to use different scoring systems may be added in the future.*
#### Winning
The game is won when one of the players obtains a score of 11.

*The option to configure different winning parameters may be added in the future.*
