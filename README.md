### Description
This is a pong-like game written in Typescript.
Pong is a table-tennis themed two-dimensional twitch sports game.
The original Pong was released by Atari in 1972 and created by Allan Alcorn as a training excercise, and was itself based on a ping-pong game included in the Magnavox Odyssey.
### Purpose
This project was started primarily for @The-Chorus to learn how to code and how to use a Version Control System with the help of @IbisLiven. The purpose of this project is not to be useful, performant, or even very good â€” only to be a teaching oppurtunity.
### Goals
1. Learn basic coding concepts by doing.
2. Create a functioning pong-game.
3. Learn how to maintain a codebase.
4. Add features for more learning oppurtunities.
